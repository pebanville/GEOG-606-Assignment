The two NETCDF files are the datasets to be used in the Code:

'tsi.ref50abrupt1500yrev.nc': data from Dynamic Ocean Simulation

'tsi.ref50osst1500y.nc': data from Prescribed SST Simulation

The Jupyter notebook file 'GEOG 606 Assignment Code.ipynb' contains the code to analyse the data and create figures
